Hello internet! I am excited to finally have my own website as a place to share not only my personal experiences but business ventures. I want to first introduce a little about myself. 

I was born in the great state of Oregon back in 1989 and spent my early childhood days in the town of Redmond. I was fortunite to have all my closest family live within 30 miles of each other and couldn't of asked for a better way to grow and learn. At the age of 12 my family and I moved to Corsicana Texas where we resided for a year. I spent my Freshman year of High School their before moving to where I now call home, Cookeville TN. 

Growing up I was your average boy that loved sports, video games, and most of all neighborhood friends. I am an only child, so imagination was key! Golf was my main sport and is still a passion of mine today, althought I don't get to play as often as I would like. I made my way to the Varsity squad all four years of High School and helped lead both state high schools to regionals, missing state by only a few strokes. 

As I landed my first job at a local Laser Tag facility I found a new love of mine, business. I was promoted to managment after only a few months and helped grow and understand the ins and outs of running a business with the owner, who has become a great mentor and friend over the years. 

In 2009 my life changed and I was able to pursue my passion of business. My family and I found out the local roller skating rink, previously occupied by Laser Tag, was going to be available for lease. After alot of thought and long nights we took the dive into entreprenuership and haven't looked back. To this day we still operate and grow the rink for our community and the roller skating industry. I can't wait to share more in future posts! :) 

A little after 3 years went by and the opportunity to buy the Laser Tag business was offered from my first boss, friend and mentor. This was crazy! Not often to you get the opportunity to purchase and operate the very first job you had and I wasn't about to let this opportunity slip. I contacted the local banks, and got a plan together. One month later the keys to another venture was in my hands. 

Apart from my full time operations at both lasertag and skating, I recently came up with a new brand for the apperal industry. We currently have 5 of us from both the U.S and abroad making this vision come to life. Keep your eye out on how your "Made To Live" 

I am so excited to have this outlet to write and share about my life. As there seems to never be a dull moment, constant change, and random event apperances, I invite you to join along for the ride!
